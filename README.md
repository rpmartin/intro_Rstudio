# intro_Rstudio

Two ways to start:

1) If you managed to install Git on your computer, click on the green button `code` and then on what looks like a clipboard beside the textbox that has `https://github.com/rpmartin/intro_Rstudio/`.  Next open Rstudio>File>New Project>Version Control>Git.  Hit control+v to paste from your clipboard into `repository URL`.  Choose where you want the project directory to go (if you are not happy with the default) and then create project.

2) Otherwise,  click on the green button `code` and then `download zip`.  Unzip the entire directory structure (not just the files) where you want the project directory to go.  Open Rstudio>File>New Project>Existing Directory and choose the directory that you unzipped, and then create project.
